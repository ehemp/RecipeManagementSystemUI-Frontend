# RecipeManagementSystemUI

A Blazor WebAssembly application to create, compare, remove, update, delete semiconductor recipes (or any recipes) with authentication and authorization features. This project implements JWT-based authentication using .NET 8, Entity Framework Core, and Blazor components to manage user state and UI updates dynamically.

## Description

ðŸš€ Features

User Authentication: JWT-based login/logout

Role-Based Authorization: Access control for different user roles

State Management: Uses AuthenticationStateProvider to update UI dynamically

Blazor Components: Modular design with AuthGuard for route protection

LocalStorage Integration: Stores authentication tokens securely with expiration

ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

Frontend: Blazor WebAssembly, C#, Razor Components

Backend: .NET Core 8+, ASP.NET Web API, Entity Framework Core

Database: SQL Server / PostgreSQL

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token), BCrypt for password hashing

State Management: Blazored.LocalStorage, AuthenticationStateProvider

Compare: Choose 2 recipes to compare and UI will display differences

Export: Export any recipe or the list of recipes to csv

## Landmarks and Roadblocks
I wanted to challenge myself and create a full-stack .Net web application. I plan on updating features and fixing bugs to further increase my knowledge and skills. I ran into some roadblocks here and there. For example, having the NavBar render or not depending on authentication state has me going in circles until I stepped away for a bit and realized I just needed to update a state according to the AuthService class and have it render dependent on that bool value. Getting the authorization to work correclty was somewhat challenging, but overall I am happy about the solution.
More updates to come...
